# ComeTogetherProject

This is a Social Media App created from a school project.
It is designed to be used with a Tomcat server backend that connects to an SQL Server hosted on Azure for a database.
Users can create accounts, create and edit events and mark whether they're going, or want to go to an event.
Users can also add friends and view their current friend list.
